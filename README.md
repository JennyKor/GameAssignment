# GameAssignment

<p>Small individual game assignment that was part of the game development module, made before <a href="https://github.com/JennyKor/GameGroupProject"> the group project</a>.</p>
<p>A short one level 2D-platformer I made in three days. I've made some fixes since grading, but it's still missing enemies I originally wanted to add. I'll probably come back to this someday to make it longer and add that additional danger. Also the layers are giving me headaches, so I will have to do a complete overhaul for the UI.</p>
